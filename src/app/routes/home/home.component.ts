          The SMART COVID Navigator connects patient information from multiple EHR servers to an AI- powered knowledge map of COVID-19 research. This will allow clinicians to access the latest data-driven research based on a particular patientâ€™s risk factors. The Navigator builds on the framework developed by the SMART Cancer Navigator, which offered clinical decision support by connecting patient EHR information to cancerous gene-variants. The Navigator is a further step in creating FHIR-protocol based tools to support personalized medicine.
          The web-based app was built by researchers at the Biomedical Cybernetics Laboratory in Harvard Medical School. It was created using an Angular and bootstrap front-end framework.</p>

Through the built-in feedback functionality, meaningful responses regarding the usability and efficacy of the app are conveyed to the designers.
